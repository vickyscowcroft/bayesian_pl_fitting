**A Python notebook for processing of parallaxes, comparison with variable star distances and inference of line of sight interstellar extinction to said variable stars.**


## Use

So far, a single Jupyter notebook file is the entire script. It is currently in development towards a functional barebones first version, after which Emily should really update this readme to be more informative.


## Dependencies

* Python 3
* A number of packages, currently all listed at the top of the file. Most of these are in the Astroconda distribution.
